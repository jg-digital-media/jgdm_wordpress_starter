The number of ceramic veneers required is only part of the expense.\r\nEmprethin is an extremely thin veneer made from pressed ceramic that is roughly 0.2 \r\nmm - 0.Four mm thick. Lumineer by Cerinate is an ultra-skinny (0.2 mm) porcelain veneer.\r\nPorcelain veneers are extra stain resistant and look extra like natural teeth than resin veneers.\r\nVeneers may be placed in about two visits. Bonding can repair and \r\nreplace chipped, cracked, broken or decayed tooth.\r\nI\'ve seen bonding last for just a few years however that has been the exception to the rule.\r\nClinical testing reveals that ultra-thin veneers can final and look great for as much as 20 years.\r\n\r\nBoth Lumineer and Ultrathin are ceramic porcelain veneers which are bonded onto the entrance of the teeth.\r\n\"Hi, I bought a very massive bridge made due to missing teeth recently and my total expertise was extremely optimistic.

All that fishing around for the core Git files didn’t seem to help.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But earlier on something weird and unexpected happened. I got an email in my associated GitHub email account telling me a new public key was added.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I didn’t have a clue how that happened or what it meant, but earlier on I had opened the GitHub GUI application and had a poke a round.  A cleaned out a couple of redundant repositories and scanned for the latest ones.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a test, I attempted to clone a remote repository on Github.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote {\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<blockquote style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>C:\\path\\to\\repo> git clone http://github.com/username/repo.<br> git<br> Cloning into \'ugliestcss\'…<br> remote: Counting objects: 37, done.<br> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (26/26), done.<br> remote: Total 37 (delta 10), reused 36 (delta 9), pack-reused 0<br> Unpacking objects: 100% (37/37), done.<br> Checking connectivity… done.</p><cite>git clone output in a Git terminal</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I gasped with excitement  I’d just successfully cloned a GitHub repository .</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I pressed on.  If I’ve been able to get on to GitHub and fork a repository to my computer, surely I’ll be able to put my local repository onto my remote. If I’m right, here I next needed to set up the local files to be pushed up to GitHub.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>cd new_repo<br> C:\\path\\to\\repo\\new_repo [master]> git remote add origin https://github.com/jg-digital-media/new_repo.git<br> fatal: remote origin already exists.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not exactly encouraging; I didn’t quite know what that meant. but I took a leap of faith. I think it’s telling me that the files are ready to pushed to GitHub. A link to the remote repository as it were</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I just tried the next step</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote {\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<blockquote style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>C:\\path\\to\\repo\\new_repo [master]> git push origin master<br> Counting objects: 3, done.<br> Delta compression using up to 4 threads.<br> Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.<br> Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 787 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.<br> Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)<br> To https://github.com/jg-digital-media/new_repo.git</p><cite>Create a link to a github repository and push commits to it.</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>[new branch]      master -&gt; master<br>\nC:\\Users\\PC2\\Documents\\GitHub\\new_repo [master]&gt;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And sure enough the repository, just a simple file at the moment is now up on GitHub.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So what was it that made it work? Opening the GUI application automatically sending an SSH key?  I believe so. I’m reliably informed that behind the scenes the GUI application that ships with Git/GitHub communicates with your GitHub account to create a connection, for each repository so you don#’t have to input a username and password every time you push and pull changes to your work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the last few days I’ve created small repositories with dummy/test work, broken things and started a fresh with new repositories. With practice, I’m getting there and the foggy areas of the Git workflow for me are clearing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote {\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<blockquote style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>git remote add origin https://github.com/jg-digital-media/new_repo.git<br> git push origin master</p><cite>Command to create a link to a repository and then push commits</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Where the first command creates a connection to a repository called origin (this could in fact be any name you give) the second command actually looks for the repository and sends the updated files to Github, branch by branch with the master branch being the default branch.  You’d have to specify a different branch if you wanted to update the contents of that branch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So what about large scale projects like WordPress websites or game/software development? Well I suppose that will only come with time spent and self confidence.  The thing to remember about scrolling through the commits is to make them identifiable and memorable.  So long as we make fast and frequent comments to the work the work history will always be there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'Managing projects with Git', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '32-revision-v1', '', '', '2019-02-26 11:08:44', '2019-02-26 11:08:44', '', 32, 'https://blog.jonniegrieve.co.uk/2019/02/26/32-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Pretty much everything we do on it requires us to interact with a form. So I\'m really pleased I\'ve finally set aside good time to work on this. As I write this, it all still seems like a big mountain to climb but at least now I can see the summit in view.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I wanted to create a set of forms that handled email, returned values from the full range of form inputs, hidden form inputs, handles form redirects and submits data across more than one page.

Let me summarise a couple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> <strong>\"php doesn\'t stop the form from processing\"</strong> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first is that PHP forms will not pause submission even if it picks up validation errors. It doesn\'t work that way. So in my mind, I was just thinking to myself... \"<em>then how on earth can I stop empty or duplicate forms being sent to a client</em>\".  That was the very question that prompted me to get on to do this entire project.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to stop a form from submitting with its default behaviour, you need to use another language such as JavaScript. That\'s where it can get tricky because some users elect to switch JavaScript functionality off from their browser. So as well as client-side<em> validation, you need to take care of validation on the server-side too. So at that point,</em> you think <em>\"but that means without JavaScript I\'m back to square one\"! </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>\"You should only think of client-side validation as something you use to improve/hence the user experience\"</strong> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Which brings me to my second point; you should only think of JavaScript validation as a courtesy to the user. A means to provide a good UX experience for a user filling in an online form. But if JavaScript is not available then PHP (or server-side validation) is your failsafe.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Form validation in the server-side is not about pausing submission of a form when there\'s failing validation, but writing the script to perform different actions based on when data is returned.

It\'s a collection of web forms I\'ve made for various reasons and purposes. Functional forms that send data to a server and/or send emails.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I\'ve been in the tech/web design industry for a long time. And one of the things I\'ve struggled with the most in my journey is how to write a good form.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What I mean by a good form is one that sends an email but only when all validation checks have been passed. And not only this but how to adequately convey to a frustrated user of a form that an error has occurred and how to fix it.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using a form is fundamental to using the internet. Pretty much everything we do on it requires us to interact with a form. So I\'m really pleased I\'ve finally set aside good time to work on this. As I write this, it all still seems like a big mountain to climb but at least now I can see the summit in view.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I wanted to create a set of forms that handled email, returned values from the full range of form inputs, hidden form inputs, handles form redirects and submits data across more than one page. As it stands at the time of publishing I have a set of forms that do these things. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How I did it</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once I\'d decided I wanted to do this, I spent a lot of time researching tutorials and examples of web forms out there including validation of web forms on both the client-side and the server-side.

Let me summarise a couple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> <strong>\"php doesn\'t stop the form from processing\"</strong> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first is that PHP forms will not pause submission even if it picks up validation errors. It doesn\'t work that way. So in my mind, I was just thinking to myself... \"<em>then how on earth can I stop empty or duplicate forms being sent to a client</em>\".  That was the very question that prompted me to get on to do this entire project.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to stop a form from submitting with its default behaviour, you need to use another language such as JavaScript. That\'s where it can get tricky because some users elect to switch JavaScript functionality off from their browser. So as well as client-side<em> validation, you need to take care of validation on the server-side too. So at that point,</em> you think <em>\"but that means without JavaScript I\'m back to square one\"! </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>\"You should only think of client-side validation as something you use to improve/hence the user experience\"</strong> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Which brings me to my second point; you should only think of JavaScript validation as a courtesy to the user. A means to provide a good UX experience for a user filling in an online form. But if JavaScript is not available then PHP (or server-side validation) is your failsafe.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Form validation in the server-side is not about pausing submission of a form when there\'s failing validation, but writing the script to perform different actions based on when data is returned. And it is easier than I ever thought to make sure an email does not send when validation fails.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Managing the project </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I want to discuss a little bit about how I developed the project as it got bigger and more forms were introduced. This has not been without its problems and I\'ve had to overcome some issues along the way.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because of the way I have structured this project; by putting each form example in its own directory structure; I had to find a way of getting the base styles (that is the styles that stay the same throughout the website) to apply to the pages for each form example. So that I didn\'t have to copy the SASS partials over every time I wanted to make a change.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To do this I made sure each directory and file structure was the same and simply imported the SASS partials using an @import directive on each equivalent partial from the base directory to that directory. I then import like this....  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p>@import \"../../../form_project/assets/styles/common/pages/main.scss\";</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then I am free to add more SASS partials for unique styles. Styles that won\'t be the same across plages.  This means that they\'d take a new place in the cascade, rather than one style constantly overriding the other.  I started out that way and it got messy very quickly causing funny things to happen in the browser.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This fix was great but it did mean of course that I had to run several different sass commands every time I make such a change but I felt that it was a better solution than trawling endlessly through files in my text editor. This way I can run the changes via the command line and let SASS do the heavy lifting. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:shortcode -->\ncd ../../assets/styles\nsass --watch style.scss:style.css\ncd ../../form_handling/styles\nsass --watch style.scss:style.css\n<!-- /wp:shortcode -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In a similar way, I imported PHP files using PHP\'s <em>require</em> method.

So these are not images that could have been easily targeted to reduce resources.

Most of my images are stored in directories according to their\r\nintended use.  As I began the process,\r\nthis is the total size of each directory.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<em>Featured directory:  2.4mb\r\nServices directory:  200kb</em>\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nThese were all <strong>.PNG</strong> files.

Correctly sizing and compressing images can help save a little space but is also an important consideration for retina display devices.  Delivering images that are appropriately compressed and sized to their container will reduce file sizes, otherwise, it is wasted bandwidth.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nThe theory is that by halving the size of the image when you export the file reduces the number of pixels that need to be displayed by the time it is shown in the browser.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nSo when you start exporting in your image editor:\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>1024 by 768 becomes</li>\r\n 	<li>532 by 399   (twice the resolution)</li>\r\n 	<li>266 by 200 pixels</li>\r\n 	<li>Natural 532 by 399</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nSo the pixels rendered should be showing reduced compared to natural/intrinsic value.

Correctly sizing and compressing images can help save a little space but is also an important consideration for retina display devices.&nbsp; Delivering images that are appropriately compressed and sized to their container will reduce file sizes, otherwise, it is wasted bandwidth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The theory is that by halving the size of the image when you export the file reduces the number of pixels that need to be displayed by the time it is shown in the browser.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So when you start exporting in your image editor: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li> 1024 by 768 becomes </li><li> 532 by 399&nbsp;&nbsp; (twice the resolution) </li><li> 266 by 200 pixels </li><li> Natural 532 by 399  </li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So the pixels rendered should be showing reduced compared to natural/intrinsic value. But as of the day of posting this blog, this is not happening for me.&nbsp; </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I\'m going to look at this further but for now I\'m happy with the performance savings I have so far made.&nbsp; I’ve reduced the bandwidth by more than half and significantly increased my website speed.&nbsp; I’ve learned a lot during this process and the techniques I\'ve learned in this blog are standard I intend to follow going forward. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'A Learning Process: Front End Performance Optimisation', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '102-revision-v1', '', '', '2019-11-13 12:03:30', '2019-11-13 12:03:30', '', 102, 'https://blog.jonniegrieve.co.uk/102-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

They tally up the resources, HTTP Requests and bandwidth used and this is the crux of where I started out with.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:quote -->\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><strong>38 requests -  134 KB transferred  - 2.2 MB resources - Finish: 1.67 </strong>\r\n\r\n<cite>first check</cite></blockquote>\r\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nIt\'s worth pointing out at this point that some of these numbers are network dependent and some are finite. It shows that as of a few weeks ago (October 2019), I was serving up to <strong>2.2MB</strong> of data, only <strong>134kb</strong> of which I was actually choosing to render in the HTML. So not exactly the most bandwidth straining of websites, but this is deliberately so. And it\'s not necessarily the case that this means a 100% speedy experience but again that depends on what your network speed is.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nFinally, after a brief check, there did not appear to be any unused assets so no HTTP 404 errors were returned and no wasted resources.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>Optimising images</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nMost of the 2.2mb total consists of images that were simply not optimised. Indeed the design includes a main background image that is fixed on scroll that I edited a little bit on Photoshop and exported as an image file with barely a second thought to optimisation.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nLet\'s look at the main background image as an example.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:quote -->\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><em>interior-darker.png  - 1,739.kb\r\nimg/ios-bg.png   - 14kb</em></blockquote>\r\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nSo those background images on their own represented the vast majority of the resources I was using.  So what could be done to reduce that load?\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nI went back into Photoshop and opened the image up and exported the file using \"save for web\". Using this, I saved a copy of the image with a 60% quality level with progressive download style and this time I saved it as a jpeg.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n4,323,001 bytes reduced to 473,322kb  (a saving of 3,849,679 bytes) 4,323,001  - 3,849,679 is an <strong>89.05%</strong> saving\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nAn 89% saving just on the background image served alone.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:quote -->\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><strong>35 requests  129 KB transferred  2.1 MB resources  Finish: 2.01 s    </strong>\r\n\r\n<cite>The latest savings</cite></blockquote>\r\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>SVG Sprite Maps</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nThe \"Service\" section images on my <a href=\"https://www.jonniegrieve.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"website (opens in a new tab)\">website</a> are served via a font <strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN)</strong>. So these are not images that could have been easily targeted to reduce resources. I wanted to see if there was a way to serve some of my service icons the same sprite map but these are fonts rather than SVG\'s but that\'s not the case.  I was, however, able to use SVG for social media icons.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nUsing this method I created a sprite map of several\r\ncontained SVG’s in one resource so only one HTTP Request was taken up.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:quote -->\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><strong>31 requests  156 KB transferred  1.1 MB resources Finish: 1.51 s  Load: 1.52 s</strong>\r\n\r\n<cite>Performance Savings: Round 3</cite></blockquote>\r\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nHaving looked at my main background images and social media\r\nicons I then turned my attention to the rest of the images and how they could\r\nbe optimised. Most of my images are stored in directories according to their\r\nintended use.  As I began the process,\r\nthis is the total size of each directory.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<em>Featured directory:  2.4mb\r\nServices directory:  200kb</em>\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nThese were all <strong>.PNG</strong> files. I switched the majority of PNG\'s now from PNG to JPG using the same export settings for the main background image (60% quality compared to the PNG\'S and progressive download).  The result of this was that resources and transfers now <strong>total less than 1mb</strong>.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<em>Featured directory: 992 KB (1,015,808 bytes)\r\nServices Directory:  135kb</em>\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:quote -->\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><strong>31 requests 754 KB transferred  993 KB resources  Finish: 2.39 s  Load: 1.77 s</strong></blockquote>\r\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nSo, for the first time the resources show up as taking less than a 1mb in served resources. Great!\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nThere is a video asset in this website. Videos typically take up more bandwidth than image files whether they are served by an external CDN or not. I made the decision to stick to an HTML5 video tag rather than embedding a YouTube link. I may investigate further but for now, the video takes up the bandwidth.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>Minifying the JavaScript and CSS</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nMinifying files is the process of reducing the file size of CSS and JS assets by stripping out comments and any spaces in the code. Typically this is done using a build tool which can add to the website payload, but since this is only a small website, I opted to use online tools to minify my files.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nMinifying files like this saved me a further <strong>6kb</strong> which is a minimal benefit in this case but I felt it only right to do it.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:quote -->\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><strong>34 requests 739 KB transferred 859 KB resources Finish: 4.25 s Load: 3.71 s</strong>\r\n\r\n<cite>Last check. - remember some of these results are network dependent</cite></blockquote>\r\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>Resizes and Compressed Images</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nThe last thing I want to talk about is the process of image display resolution. Display resolution refers to how devices display images in their browsers. Correctly sizing and compressing images can help save a little space but is also an important consideration for retina display devices.  Delivering images that are appropriately compressed and sized to their container will reduce file sizes, otherwise, it is wasted bandwidth.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nThe theory is that by halving the size of the image when you export the file reduces the number of pixels that need to be displayed by the time it is shown in the browser.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nSo when you start exporting in your image editor:\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>1024 by 768 becomes</li>\r\n 	<li>532 by 399   (twice the resolution)</li>\r\n 	<li>266 by 200 pixels</li>\r\n 	<li>Natural 532 by 399</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nSo the pixels rendered should be showing reduced compared to natural/intrinsic value. But as of the day of posting this blog, this is not happening for me.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\nSo I\'m going to look at this further but for now I\'m happy with the performance savings I have so far made.  I’ve reduced the bandwidth by more than half and significantly increased my website speed.  I’ve learned a lot during this process and the techniques I\'ve learned in this blog are standard I intend to follow going forward.\r\n\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'A Learning Process: Front End Performance Optimisation', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '102-revision-v1', '', '', '2021-01-22 09:57:59', '2021-01-22 09:57:59', '', 102, 'http://localhost/wordpress/subdomain/2021/01/22/102-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
